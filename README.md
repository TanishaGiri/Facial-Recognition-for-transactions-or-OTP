Develop a system that balances the need for security with the user's convenience and privacy while ensuring the technology's accuracy and reliability.

# Problem Statement
Authenticating a customer in an online credit card transaction has been a challenge, as there is no foolproof method to do so. Authentication involves verifying the credit card owner during a purchase. In the physical world, this is accomplished through a signature, which is manually checked at the point of sale. However, without an effective way to authenticate customers in online transactions, several issues may arise, including fraudulent transactions, a lengthy transaction process, reduced customer confidence, and higher transaction costs.

# Existing Systems
A basic multi-factor authentication system typically involves requesting a user's username and password, which are something they know, as well as verifying their identity through a second factor, such as a text message sent to their phone, which is something they have. While this covers two factors of authentication, incorporating image recognition technology can add an additional layer of security to the login process without causing undue frustration or complexity for authorized users.
